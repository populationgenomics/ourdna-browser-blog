The vast majority of this excess cost was due to users spinning up machines in international regions and reading data from our US-region storage bucket.</p>\n<p>As a result, we have decided to move gnomAD Hail tables and matrix tables to a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/requester-pays\">requester-pays</a> bucket, while keeping the VCFs and smaller public files free to download as usual. We decided to do this for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>From our beginnings as a project, we have been committed to making gnomAD data as free and accessible to the world as humanly possible. We pay for each VCF download of our data, and we have resisted proposals to add gating mechanisms (such as click-through agreements) to our data. We want to reaffirm our commitment to our users by continuing to make VCFs free to download to our growing user base.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, to maintain gnomAD, we must keep costs as low as possible and fund aspects of gnomAD that benefit the widest user base. Providing free access to the Hail-formatted versions of the data is very costly and benefits only a small proportion of our user base—those running cloud pipelines on the data. Therefore, we have decided to require users to supply Google Cloud billing information when they access Hail versions of gnomAD.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","fields":{"slug":"/2020-07-requester-pays-notice/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 09, 2020","title":"Requester-Pays Notice to Users","authors":["gnomAD Production Team"],"categories":["Announcements"]}}}]}},"pageContext":{"author":"gnomAD Production Team"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3159585216"],"slicesMap":{}}
